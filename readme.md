# Tic Tac Toe Game
Or noughts and crosses for my friends across the pond

This is just a simple implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. I've been throwing together some simple web apps lately using the most vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript setup possible as an exercise in applying the knowledge gained using complex tools such as React to something more basic. I hacked this together pretty quickly and there's nothing to crazy about it, but everything is working as intended and I've kept things pretty light and simlpe (aside from drawing the line over the winning cells).
